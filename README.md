PinPoint - A Mobile Data Capture App
=================================

PinPoint is the result of a project from a minor Geographic Information Systems at the University of Twente. It is a web app that allows users to collect data out in the field and download it to analyse the collected data. It allows for multiple people to work on a project simultaneously. 

A demonstration of our functioning project can be found at: steftaz.pythonanywhere.com. Our code is open source and if you like to use this product yourself we suggest you find a hosting place of your own. Please read the added license before using our product. Also make sure to read through the requirements.

Documentation of how to use our product can be found on the webpages itself and on the user guide page. 

How to deploy PinPoin:
- Clone the git repository.
- Navigate to the mobile-gis folder in your terminal.
- Type: 'python manage.py migrate' to initialize the database.
- Type: 'python manage.py runserver' to run PinPoint on localhost.
